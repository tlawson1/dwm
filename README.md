# dwm
My fork of dwm

## Patches
- **Fullgaps:** adds gaps between client windows.

## Hotkeys
There is no need for me to specify what the hotkeys are here, this is dwm afterall. Check the `config.h` file if you'd like to know the hotkeys. 

**Note:** The key combination of **Mod + Shift  + Esc** runs the command ```sudo shutdown -P now```. This will not work without configuring sudo to allow this command to be run for your user without the password.
